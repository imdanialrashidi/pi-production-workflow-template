# Quality Contract

This file defines the evaluator-facing quality bar for meaningful changes. Keep it project-specific after `/bootstrap`; do not turn it into a generic checklist dump.

## Release rule

A change is not complete because the code compiles or the happy-path test passes. Every accepted behavior must be implemented rather than stubbed, exercised at the appropriate layer, and supported by evidence.

A required criterion that is unproven is **not passed**.

## Functional completeness

For accepted scope:

- controls that imply behavior must actually perform that behavior;
- persistence must survive the lifecycle promised by the product;
- displayed state must come from the authoritative source rather than a convenient fake;
- required error, empty, loading, disabled, success, permission, retry, and recovery states must behave coherently;
- no accepted feature may be satisfied by a placeholder, TODO handler, mock response, display-only control, or hard-coded success path unless the contract explicitly says it is a prototype.

## Correctness

- Preserve domain invariants across success and failure paths.
- Validate external/untrusted data at boundaries.
- Handle retries, duplicate requests, time, rounding, ordering, partial failure, and concurrency where they are material to the changed behavior.
- A production bug should gain regression evidence when practical.
- Tests should assert behavior and contracts rather than implementation trivia.

## Security and data integrity

For trust-boundary changes, require the `risk-review` workflow.

At minimum:

- authorization and ownership are enforced server-side;
- client-provided roles, prices, payment/subscription states, ownership, and permissions are never authoritative;
- secrets and sensitive data do not enter source, logs, screenshots, fixtures, prompts, or public artifacts;
- money/callback/state-transition operations are verified, idempotent, replay-aware, and auditable where applicable;
- schema/data changes have compatibility, rollback/recovery, and failure-path reasoning.

## User-facing quality

For rendered interfaces:

- exercise the critical journey in the real browser when browser behavior matters;
- preserve keyboard access, visible focus, semantic controls, labels, contrast, touch targets, and reduced-motion behavior;
- check realistic data, long text, localization/RTL when relevant, and at least one narrow viewport for mobile-facing surfaces;
- use existing design tokens/components and avoid unrelated redesign;
- do not add explanatory copy that merely restates obvious UI;
- visual polish cannot compensate for missing interaction depth or broken behavior.

## Reliability and performance

Apply only where relevant to the changed path:

- avoid unbounded reads/work, N+1 access, duplicate calls, uncontrolled concurrency, and blocking hot paths;
- use explicit timeouts/cancellation/retries where the boundary requires them;
- preserve meaningful non-sensitive logs or diagnostics for critical transitions;
- performance claims require a reproducible baseline and after-measurement;
- a flaky test or intermittent runtime path is a reliability defect, not automatic permission to weaken the gate.

## Maintainability and architecture

- Prefer existing project patterns and stable framework/platform primitives.
- Keep public interfaces small and backward-compatible unless a breaking change is accepted.
- Keep business rules separable from presentation/transport when the existing architecture supports it.
- New abstractions should solve more than one real current use case or remove a demonstrated risk/duplication.
- New dependencies require a concrete benefit over existing/platform capabilities.
- Architecture invariants that matter repeatedly should be enforced mechanically with types, lint rules, structural tests, schemas, or CI rather than prose alone.

## Evidence hierarchy

Prefer stronger evidence when practical:

1. deterministic automated test of the accepted behavior;
2. real browser/API/database exercise of the relevant journey;
3. type/lint/structural/static analysis for invariant classes;
4. reproducible measurement for performance/reliability claims;
5. focused manual inspection for aspects that cannot be automated economically.

A reviewer or subagent opinion alone is not proof.

## Evaluator rubric

An evaluator should assess the accepted contract, not invent adjacent scope.

For each acceptance criterion return one of:

- **PASS** — implementation and evidence satisfy the criterion;
- **FAIL** — evidence demonstrates incorrect/incomplete behavior;
- **UNPROVEN** — implementation may exist but adequate evidence is missing;
- **BLOCKED** — a genuine prerequisite prevents verification.

Then inspect cross-cutting regression risk only where the diff makes it relevant.

The overall task cannot be called complete while a required criterion is `FAIL` or `UNPROVEN`, or while a required independent review has an unresolved BLOCKER/MAJOR finding.

## Project-specific quality invariants

`/bootstrap` should replace this paragraph with a concise set of confirmed project-specific rules and canonical commands where the repository provides enough evidence. Examples might include an architectural dependency direction, exact accessibility target, API compatibility guarantee, performance budget, supported browser/device matrix, or canonical release gate.

Do not invent quality targets that the product or repository has not accepted.
