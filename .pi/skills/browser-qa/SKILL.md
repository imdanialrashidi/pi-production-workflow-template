# Browser QA

Use real browser evidence only where browser behavior matters.

## Browser tool roles

Use Playwright MCP through the `mcp` proxy for interactive exploration:

- navigation;
- accessibility snapshots and focused snapshot search;
- click, type, form, keyboard, dialog, resize, and tab interactions;
- console inspection;
- network request inspection;
- screenshots when appearance materially matters.

Use repository-local Playwright Test or the project's browser-test scripts for durable regression coverage and CI evidence.

Do not treat a successful MCP interaction as a replacement for a committed deterministic test.

The MCP configuration intentionally does not expose arbitrary JavaScript evaluation, local file upload, drag-and-drop file injection, or MCP scripting. Do not attempt to work around those restrictions.

## Order of operations

1. Start or reuse the narrowest relevant local server.
2. Reproduce the affected journey with Playwright MCP or the narrowest existing browser test.
3. Prefer `browser_find` or `browser_snapshot` for locating controls and understanding state.
4. Inspect console errors, failed requests, accessibility semantics, and visible state.
5. Capture screenshots only when layout or appearance is materially relevant.
6. With a text-only primary model, use `describe_image` on a saved screenshot with a focused question when visual interpretation is needed; with a multimodal primary, reference the screenshot directly.
7. Fix the smallest confirmed defect.
8. Add or update a deterministic regression test.
9. Rerun the affected spec or last failed tests.
10. Run the feature lane once at completion.

## MCP usage pattern

Use the single `mcp` proxy tool:

1. search for the required Playwright capability;
2. describe the selected tool before first use when its arguments are unclear;
3. call only the narrowest tool needed;
4. keep large snapshots focused by using `browser_find`, target refs, depth, or saved files;
5. close the browser when the exploration is complete.

Use screenshots as visual evidence, not as the primary interaction mechanism. Accessibility snapshots are preferred for actions.

## Local resource policy

- Never set `CI=1`.
- Use one relevant browser project and one worker.
- Use zero retries and fail fast.
- Keep video, trace, and automatic screenshots off.
- Reuse running servers.
- Do not build unrelated applications.
- Avoid fixed sleeps; use locator assertions, events, or response conditions.
- Avoid `networkidle` as a general readiness signal.
- Prepare server state through fixtures or APIs rather than repeated UI setup.
- Default to no more than two vision-model calls per affected user flow.

## Visual quality

Check:

- a named mobile and desktop critical viewport; add a middle breakpoint only when composition changes there;
- RTL/LTR where applicable;
- overflow, clipping, spacing, hierarchy, and typography;
- loading, empty, error, disabled, success, and permission states;
- keyboard navigation, focus, labels, semantics, contrast, touch targets, and reduced motion;
- long text and realistic data.

For a material visual change, read `docs/DESIGN.md`, load `frontend-design`, and separate two passes:

1. **Product pass:** real journey, semantics, input modes, required states, console/network evidence, responsive behavior, and measurable budgets.
2. **Studio pass:** screenshots judged against the accepted thesis, signature element, anti-template check, and visual-quality rubric.

Capture the smallest reproducible evidence set:

- route and named state/fixture;
- exact viewport;
- theme and locale/direction;
- desktop, narrow mobile, and one demanding state when relevant.

Use the same deterministic state when comparing iterations. Do not use a screenshot from an unspecified or transient state as release proof. If appearance cannot be rendered, mark visual acceptance `UNPROVEN`.

Do not create decorative copy merely to explain obvious UI. Supporting text must prevent ambiguity or error and must add information.

## Test placement

Use unit/integration tests instead of browser E2E for pure sorting, filtering, mapping, formatting, validation, reducers, calculations, or state transitions.
